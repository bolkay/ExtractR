  <string name="about_extractr">
    ExtractR\'s use is simple and straightforward. It helps you to quickly extract all images from a PDF file
    easily. Before finalising your work, it lets you remove images that you don\'t need. You can export to your gallery, 
    a PDF containing the images or a compressed ZIP file with the images. 
    If there is any problem or there is a feature that you would like to see
    , please feel free to use the report button in the preferences tab. Thank you so much for trying ExtractR.
